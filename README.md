# Java Login Program with Three Attempts

This Java program is a simple login application that allows a user three attempts to enter a correct username and password. After three failed attempts, the program terminates.

## How It Works

- The program defines a hardcoded username and password (for demonstration purposes).
- It allows the user three attempts to enter the correct username and password.
- For each attempt, it prompts the user to enter the username and password.
- The password input is masked with asterisks (*) for security.
- If the entered username and password match the hardcoded values, the user is logged in, and the program exits.
- If the login is unsuccessful after three attempts, the program informs the user and terminates.

## Usage

1. Compile the program:

2. Run the program:

## Customization

You can customize this program by:

- Changing the hardcoded username and password in the code to match your desired authentication data.
- Modifying the number of allowed login attempts by adjusting the `attempts` variable.
